## Known Bugs or Issues

Currently there are no Bugs or Issues that I know of and this was a pretty straight forward assignment mostly related to modifying existing html, css, and javascript in order to refresh ourselves on this assignment.

## Experience

I have done alot of work with HTML and CSS and so it was nice to have an easier refresher with this assignment. I do feel like my JS experienc could be improved so I am excited to get the time to work on that and improve my skills with that.
